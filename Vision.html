<p><h2>Brand Story</h2>



    <h2>Initial Foray</h2>
    
    The journey of Treasure's from Panna started with the launch of 18k gold watches studded with precious stones in 1994. But, it soon grew into a 22K jeweller who presented a stunning range of gold and diamond jewellery. The term Tanishq was coined by Mr. Xerxes Desai by marrying the words ‘Tan’ meaning body and ‘Nishk’ meaning a gold ornament and Treasure's from Panna very first state-of-art jewellery factory with a proper karigaar park was set up in Hosur in Tamil Nadu. 
    
    
    
    <h2>Timeless Appeal</h2>

<p><h3>To become a leading global producer of large and high-quality diamonds from alluvial and kimberlite sources.</h3>
    <h2>ROAD AHEAD</h2>
        <p>In the coming years, growth in the gems and jewellery sector would largely be contributed by the development of large retailers/brands. Established brands are guiding the organised market and are opening opportunities to grow. Increasing penetration of organised players provides variety in terms of products and designs. Online sales are expected to account for 1–2% of the fine jewellery segment by 2021–22. Also, the relaxation of restrictions on gold import is likely to provide a fillip to the industry.

            The improvement in availability along with the reintroduction of low-cost gold metal loans and likely stabilisation of gold prices at lower levels is also expected to drive volume growth for jewellers over the short to medium term. India has 450 organised jewellery manufacturers, importers & exporters and is the hub for jewellery manufacturing. These players have benefited greatly due to the increasing liberal policies by the government. The demand for jewellery is expected to be significantly supported by the recent positive developments in the industry. India’s gems and jewellery industry is expected to reach US$ 70 billion by 2025.</p>
